Step 1: Collect Sample

	- Obtained a sample phishing email impersonating "Kaufland."

Step 2: Sender Spoofing Check (via EML Analyzer)

	- Checked visible name vs actual email (Kaufland Team vs service@stayfriends.de).
	
	- Identified domain mismatch (stayfriends.de not related to Kaufland).

	- SPF failed, and DKIM/DMARC were missing.

	- Sender IP (45.143.92.114) had poor reputation (checked via WHOIS/VirusTotal).

Step 3: Header Analysis (via Header Analyzer Tool)

	- Verified mismatch between From and Return-Path fields.

	- SPF result: Fail (unauthorized IP).

	- DKIM/DMARC: Absent.

	- Mail originated from suspicious domain zpaytz.xyz.

	- Spam Confidence Level (SCL): 5 (flagged by Microsoft as suspicious).

Step 4: Malicious Link Identification

	- Found 3+ links pointing to blog.afridox.com, unrelated to Kaufland.

	- Detected hidden 1px tracking pixel.

	- No file attachments were present.
	
Step 5: Urgency & Psychological Triggers

	- Email used urgency-inducing language: “You’ve been selected,” “Join now!”

	- Pushes recipient to act quickly on the fake prize.

Step 6: Grammar and Language Checks

	- Multiple grammatical and spelling errors.

	- Inconsistent mix of German and English.

	- Machine-translation artifacts detected.

Step 7: Final Summary of Red Flags

	- Sender spoofing with unrelated domain.

	- Authentication failures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
	
	- Malicious redirect links and tracking.

	- Suspicious IP and spam score.

	- Urgency tactics and poor grammar.

	- Clear case of phishing with impersonation.
